# AI-Powered Disease Diagnosis and Reporting for Farmers

## Background
Agricultural productivity and food security depend heavily on the health of crops and livestock.  
Farmers, especially in remote or resource-limited areas, face challenges in diagnosing and reporting diseases affecting their farms.  
**Early diagnosis and timely reporting** are crucial to **prevent outbreaks and ensure effective disease management**.  

## Project Description
This project introduces a **mobile portal powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for **disease diagnosis and reporting**.  

The system enables farmers to:  
- Use **smartphones** to submit **images and descriptions** of disease symptoms.  
- Receive **AI-generated** disease predictions and recommended **preventive measures**.  
- Get **actionable advice** on managing plant and livestock diseases.  
- Automatically send alerts to **veterinarians** for timely intervention.  
- **Integrate with NDLM** (National Digital Livestock Mission) for seamless disease tracking.  

##  Expected Outcomes
- **Enhanced Disease Diagnosis** – AI-driven analysis for accurate detection.  
- **Timely Reporting & Intervention** – Faster response to prevent disease spread.  
- **Increased Access to Expert Knowledge** – AI-powered insights for better decision-making.  
- **Improved Farm Productivity** – Healthier crops and livestock leading to better yields.  
- **Data Collection & Analysis** – Aggregated reports for research and monitoring.  
- **Cost-Effective Disease Management** – AI automation reduces diagnosis costs.  
- **Farmer Empowerment & Education** – Accessible disease prevention knowledge.  
- **Integration with Existing Surveillance Systems** – Supports national and global tracking.  
- **Community Engagement & Support** – Encourages knowledge-sharing among farmers.  
- **Sustainable Agriculture Practices** – Reducing losses and promoting healthy farming.  

## Technologies Used
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML)** – Disease detection algorithms.  
- **Mobile Application Development** – User-friendly farmer interface.  
- **Cloud-Based Data Storage** – Secure storage and disease tracking.  
- **NDLM Integration** – Linking with existing digital platforms for better accessibility.
